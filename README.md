# LCRUD-Website

## Validation
Form validation using built-in validation in tangent with my own custom validation written using jQuery.
Also uses custom CSS to identify missing requirements.

## About
A version of my original website with a LCRUD list of visitors
Not a very realistic use case, unfortunately, but it satisfied the constraints given from my instructor!
